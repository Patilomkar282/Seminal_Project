To create a star schema or snowflake schema from your datasets, you need to split the information into fact and dimension tables. The fact table should contain only numeric data, while the dimension tables will hold descriptive attributes.
1. Fact Table (numeric data)

The fact table includes key numeric metrics like App_Count, Phone Purchase Year, and Average Monthly Phone Bill. It will also have a User ID as the key for joining with dimension tables.

Fact Table:
User ID	Phone Purchase Year	Average Monthly Phone Bill	App Count
1	2023	411	22
2	2021	506	11
3	2021	1173	6
4	2023	819	6
5	2019	1151	17
2. Dimension Tables
User Dimension:

This table holds descriptive information about the users like their names, age, and gender.

User Dimension:
User ID	Name	Age	Gender	College Name
1	Mrunal Bhamare	20	Female	PCCOE
2	Rutuja Kaspate	20	Female	PCCOE
3	Ayesha Parveen Shaikh	21	Female	PCCOE
4	Syeda Imtiyaz	20	Female	PCCOE
5	Omkar Patil	22	Male	PCCOE
Device Dimension:

This table stores device-related information such as device type, operating system, and phone model.

Device Dimension:
User ID	Device Type	Operating System	Phone Model	Phone Purchase Year
1	Smartphone	Android	Xiaomi	2023
2	Smartphone	Android	Samsung	2021
3	Tablet	iOS	iPhone	2021
4	Smartphone	Android	Xiaomi	2023
5	Smartphone	Android	OnePlus	2019
App Usage Dimension:

This dimension covers the apps used by the users, including favorite music, chatting apps, etc.

App Usage Dimension:
User ID	Favorite Morning App	Music App	Chat App	Photo Editing App
1	Instagram	Wynk	Instagram	No
2	WhatsApp	Spotify	WhatsApp	Remini
3	WhatsApp	Yes	WhatsApp	No
4	WhatsApp	Spotify	WhatsApp	NaN
5	WhatsApp	Spotify	WhatsApp	No
Carrier Dimension:

Contains details about the mobile carrier and data plan type.

Carrier Dimension:
User ID	Mobile Carrier	Data Plan Type
1	Carrier2	Postpaid
2	Carrier4	Postpaid
3	Carrier3	Postpaid
4	Carrier2	Postpaid
5	Carrier4	Postpaid
Schema Design:

    Star Schema:
        Fact Table: User ID, Phone Purchase Year, Average Monthly Phone Bill, App Count.
        Dimensions: User Dimension, Device Dimension, App Usage Dimension, Carrier Dimension.

    Snowflake Schema:
        Similar to the star schema, but the dimensions are further normalized. For instance, the Device Dimension can be split into Phone Model and Operating System dimensions.

With this structure, you have a relational database schema suited for analytical querying.
